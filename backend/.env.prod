# PRODUCTION SERVER SETTINGS

# IMPORTANT: Generate a NEW, DIFFERENT, and very strong secret key for production.
# You can use an online generator or run this Django command:
# python -c 'from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())'
SECRET_KEY='c#*f*@vpm6j1vv13an(tdlg7&4&za1a%5*0abdg_q1l+ov6@(@'

DEBUG=False

# We will configure the production database later on the server.
DATABASE_URL='mysql://it_desk_user:admin123@localhost:3306/it_desk_prod'

# --- FIX ---
# Added your domain names here. The server will now accept requests from both the IP and the domains.
ALLOWED_HOSTS=139.59.68.36,www.hfclotnph4fbportal.in,hfclotnph4fbportal.in

# --- FIX ---
# Changed to the secure HTTPS URL of your live frontend application. This is a critical security fix.
